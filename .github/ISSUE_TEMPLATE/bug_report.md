**What's not working?**
Describe the specific behavior you're seeing, and what you'd expect to see.

**How can I reproduce this behavior?**
Give me a handful of steps to quickly and consistently get the same behavior on my build. Example characters and sets of actions are preferred.

**Logs and such**
Please navigate to your Total War WARHAMMER III install folder and attach any `!groove_log.txt`, `lua_mod_log.txt`, and `script_log_DDMMYY_HHMM.txt` files you have **after reproducing the issue**.

Attach your `used_mods.txt` file as well, from the same folder. Please keep it under 10 mods if you want any chance of me finding the bug. Reproducing the bug with just this mod enabled is preferred.

**Further information**
Anything else you'd like me to know - clarifying details, specific circumstances, your favorite movie.
